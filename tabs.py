        Common questions about the document-based chatbot.
        
        ## General Questions
        
        ### What file types are supported?
        PDF, DOCX, and TXT files are supported.
        
        ### How many documents can I upload?
        We recommend a maximum of 50 documents for optimal performance.
        
        ### How does the chatbot know what's in my documents?
        Documents are processed into embeddings, which are semantic representations that allow the system to understand and retrieve relevant information.
        
        ### Is my data secure?
        Yes, all data remains on your Azure VM and is not shared externally.
        
        ## Technical Questions
        
        ### What if the chatbot gives incorrect information?
        The chatbot extracts information directly from your documents. If information is incorrect, check the source documents.
        
        ### Can I customize the responses?
        The system uses TF-IDF and FAISS to generate responses based on document content. Responses are generated entirely offline using only your documents.
        
        ### How do I back up the system?
        Back up the entire application directory, including the FAISS index and document metadata.
        
        ### What hardware requirements are recommended?
        For optimal performance, we recommend an Azure VM with at least 4 vCPUs, 16GB RAM, and 100GB storage.
